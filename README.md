# network-connection-app
Created during Spring 2022 in EE355, Software Design for EE. Needs improvements!

-	Applied C++ OOP knowledge with classes to create a network connection system to improve team creation process and collaboration between team members.
-	Implemented a doubly-linked list data structure to store Person objects within the Network object to improve efficiency with O(n) search and deletion and O(1) insertion time complexities.
-	Utilized private membership to allow a set of people to connect with each other and share contact information between connections without making their information publicly available.
